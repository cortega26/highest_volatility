# Highest Volatility

Tools for exploring equity price volatility.  The project includes utilities for
loading and caching price history.

## Module Layout

Reusable components now live under the unified :mod:`highest_volatility`
namespace. Importers must target the canonical package modules—caching helpers
are exposed via ``highest_volatility.cache`` and security sanitizers reside in
``highest_volatility.security``. Compatibility shims for the legacy
``src.*`` namespace have been removed, so downstream projects need to update
their imports to the ``highest_volatility.*`` modules before upgrading.

### Cache versioning

The price cache manifest format is now at version ``2``. Existing
``cache/prices`` entries created with older releases are automatically deleted
when accessed so fresh parquet and manifest files can be regenerated without
manual cleanup. Corrupt manifest files are also purged on load so the
downloader can rebuild them without manual intervention.

## Data API

A lightweight FastAPI service exposes cached price data and the Fortune ticker
universe. Build and run it with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t hv-api .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 hv-api
```

Runtime notes:

- The container publishes the API on port ``8000``; map it to a host port as
  needed (for example ``-p 8000:8000``).
- ``PYTHONPATH`` is set to ``/app/src`` so ``highest_volatility`` can be
  imported without installing the package separately.
- Override any FastAPI settings with ``HV_``-prefixed environment variables.
  Common examples include ``HV_REDIS_URL`` (default ``redis://localhost:6379/0``)
  and ``HV_CACHE_REFRESH_INTERVAL``.
- Container builds now include a Docker ``HEALTHCHECK`` that polls ``/healthz``.
  Kubernetes operators should also wire ``/readyz`` into readiness probes so
  nodes only receive traffic once Redis connectivity and background refresh
  tasks are healthy.

### Operational endpoints

- ``GET /healthz`` – liveness check reporting cache refresh task state and
  Redis reachability. Returns HTTP 503 if the background worker has failed.
- ``GET /readyz`` – readiness gate confirming Redis connectivity and a healthy
  cache backend. Returns HTTP 503 until Redis is reachable and the cache is
  initialised.

The service provides several HTTP endpoints documented in
[`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md). Refer to that guide for request/response schemas,
error handling behaviour, and configuration options. Reliability commitments,
error budgets, and alerting flows for the FastAPI layer and the ingestion jobs
live in [`docs/reliability/slo.md`](docs/reliability/slo.md). Operational drills,
chaos experiments, and performance tooling are detailed in
[`docs/reliability/testing.md`](docs/reliability/testing.md). Keep SLO dashboards
and Alertmanager rules version-controlled alongside deployments and rerun
`scripts/deploy_dashboards.py` after each release to ensure Grafana panels and
PagerDuty routes reflect the current configuration.

### Validation Notes

Cached Fortune tables may contain raw tickers that use punctuation such as dots
(``BRK.B``). The universe builder now preserves those raw strings while carrying
their normalized Yahoo Finance representation (``BRK-B``). Downstream alignment
and ranking operate on the normalized variant so that cached ``rank`` and
``company`` metadata are retained without re-enumerating positions. The
``tests/test_universe_rank_alignment.py`` coverage exercises this code path by
loading cached data with dotted tickers and ensuring the original ranks remain
intact.

Incremental price refreshes now re-request the final cached session for
intraday intervals (``1m``/``1h`` variants) so late-published bars within the
same trading day are merged correctly. The synchronous and asynchronous
fetchers share this behavior, with ``tests/test_price_fetcher.py`` verifying the
intraday cache replay alongside the existing daily interval regression.

### Batch Price Downloads

The synchronous ``download_price_history`` helper downloads tickers in chunks of
40 symbols. Each chunk is submitted to a thread pool so multiple batches can be
in-flight when ``max_workers`` is greater than one. A failed chunk will fall
back to sequential single-ticker retries inside its worker without blocking
other threads. Tune ``max_workers`` based on available CPU capacity and the
latency of your network connection; values between 4 and 8 work well for most
desktop environments. Introduce a short ``chunk_sleep`` (for example, ``0.5``
seconds) after each batch if the upstream API begins throttling requests.

Client utilities such as ``cache.store`` will hydrate missing local cache files
from this API when the ``HV_API_BASE_URL`` environment variable is set.

## Metrics

The command line interface exposes a number of built-in metrics that can be
selected with the ``--metric`` option:

- **Close-to-Close Volatility** (``cc_vol``) – annualised close-to-close volatility
- **Parkinson Volatility** (``parkinson_vol``) – Parkinson's high-low estimator
- **Garman-Klass Volatility** (``gk_vol``) – Garman–Klass volatility
- **Rogers-Satchell Volatility** (``rs_vol``) – Rogers–Satchell volatility
- **Yang-Zhang Volatility** (``yz_vol``) – Yang–Zhang volatility
- **EWMA Volatility** (``ewma_vol``) – exponentially weighted moving average volatility
- **Median Absolute Deviation Volatility** (``mad_vol``) – median absolute deviation volatility
- **Sharpe Ratio** (``sharpe_ratio``) – annualised Sharpe ratio
- **Maximum Drawdown** (``max_drawdown``) – maximum drawdown
- **Value at Risk** (``var``) – value at risk (VaR)
- **Sortino Ratio** (``sortino``) – annualised Sortino ratio

### Supplying explicit tickers

Pass one or more symbols via ``--tickers`` to bypass the Selenium-backed Fortune
scraper and operate on an ad-hoc universe. The CLI normalises the provided
strings to uppercase, removes duplicates while preserving order, and skips the
universe cache refresh. This mirrors the GitHub Actions workflow that refreshes
prices for a static watchlist each night.

## CLI Internals & Rollback Plan

The CLI now orchestrates four focused steps – universe construction, price
downloads (with sanitisation via ``highest_volatility.app.sanitization``),
metric computation, and result rendering. Each step returns a small data class
so the workflow can be unit tested in isolation and downstream tooling can
reuse the intermediate structures.

To roll back to the previous monolithic ``main`` implementation, restore
``src/highest_volatility/app/cli.py`` from the last release tag or a specific
commit and remove ``src/highest_volatility/app/sanitization.py``. For example,
``git checkout <prior-tag> -- src/highest_volatility/app/cli.py`` followed by
``git rm src/highest_volatility/app/sanitization.py`` reverts the refactor
while keeping the rest of the repository unchanged.

## Streamlit App

An interactive dashboard is available via Streamlit. It mirrors the CLI
defaults, letting you pick the lookback window, interval, metric, and minimum
observation count directly from the sidebar. Additional toggles allow skipping
Selenium validation of the Fortune universe and opting into asynchronous price
fetching.

Set up and launch the UI with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run src/highest_volatility/app/streamlit_app.py
```

The Streamlit entry point injects the repository's ``src`` directory onto
``PYTHONPATH`` when launched directly, so you can run it without an editable
install. Installing with ``pip install -e .`` remains a convenient alternative
if you prefer relying on standard packaging workflows.

The Streamlit app reads from the on-disk cache created by the CLI and API
utilities. Populate it ahead of time by running your preferred cache refresh
flow (for example, ``python scripts/refresh_cache.py``) or by hitting the FastAPI
service.

When the ``HV_API_BASE_URL`` environment variable is defined, the UI will source
missing price history directly from the FastAPI backend instead of the local
cache. Unset the variable to operate entirely offline.

Results are displayed as a sortable table with warning banners when price data
is unavailable for the selected configuration.

## Progressive Web App & Offline Workflow

The FastAPI service now ships a progressive web app (PWA) at the API root. It
loads the cached ticker universe, lets you annotate symbols, and synchronises
queued updates once connectivity is restored.

### Running locally

1. Install runtime dependencies and Playwright:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium
   ```

2. Start the API (the Docker workflow continues to work):

   ```bash
   uvicorn highest_volatility.app.api:app --reload
   ```

3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a Chromium-based browser. The service
   worker precaches the static shell and API responses so the page keeps
   rendering while offline.

4. Toggle airplane mode (or otherwise disable networking), add a note to a
   ticker, and observe the "Pending" badge. When you reconnect, the service
   automatically merges queued writes against the server using a last-write-wins
   policy and records the resolution in the audit trail.

### Testing offline sync

End-to-end coverage lives in `tests/test_pwa_offline.py`. It spins up a FastAPI
instance, drives Chromium with Playwright, and exercises the offline caching and
conflict-resolution behaviour:

```bash
pytest tests/test_pwa_offline.py --headed --browser chromium
```

Run the test headlessly by dropping the `--headed` flag. The suite will install
its own service worker and simulate disconnections via Playwright's
`context.set_offline(True)` API.

## Cache Refresh

A background task runs when the API starts, periodically refreshing cached
price data for any locally stored tickers. The interval between refreshes is
configured with the ``HV_CACHE_REFRESH_INTERVAL`` environment variable and
defaults to once every 24 hours.

A helper script is provided to refresh cached price data for all locally stored
tickers. It iterates over the tickers under `cache/prices/<interval>` and
updates each one sequentially. Each ticker's Parquet file and JSON manifest
live side by side in that directory (for example, `AAPL.parquet` and
`AAPL.json`), matching the `_paths` helper in `highest_volatility/cache/store.py`.
Set the ``HV_CACHE_ROOT`` environment variable to point cache storage to an
alternate location when deploying on ephemeral filesystems or managed hosts.

Run the scheduler from the repository root:

```bash
python scripts/refresh_cache.py
```

By default the script refreshes once per day.  To run it on a regular schedule
using cron, add an entry similar to:

```
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/repo && /usr/bin/python scripts/refresh_cache.py >> refresh.log 2>&1
```

Adjust the interval and paths as needed.

## Data Sources

A monthly GitHub Action refreshes the Fortune 500 universe. On the first day of
each month the workflow runs ``scripts/scrape_fortune_500_tickers.py`` and
commits the resulting ``fortune500_tickers.csv`` to the ``data`` branch. These
tickers serve as the basis for downstream analyses and API responses.
